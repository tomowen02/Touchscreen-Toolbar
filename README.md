# Touchscreen-Toolbar

Touchscreen toolbar is a python program made to make life easier for touchscreen windows users.

All shortcuts can be easily changed, added, and removed.

This was primarily created with note taking in mind and was designed to be used extensively by myself.
It contains some shortcuts that are useful when using FancyZones in PowerToys so if you do not have that installed, those shortcuts are easily removed.

Current buttons to trigger tools/ shortcuts (easily changed by editing commands.py and then adding a button for it in the main python file):
- Screenshot
- Multitasking screen shortcut
- On-screen keyboard
- Open OneNote
- Open Whiteboard
- Copy
- Paste
- Delete
- Hold the shift key (this is to be used in conjunction with FancyZones from Windows PowerToys and allows windows to be snapped to custom positions without the use of a keyboard)
- The buttons 'Full', 'Split', 'Vert', and 'Triple' are all shortcuts to activate specific FancyZones layouts on my PC and may not do anything for other users
- The time is also displayed at the bottom
